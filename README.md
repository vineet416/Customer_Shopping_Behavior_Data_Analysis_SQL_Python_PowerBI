# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

A comprehensive data analytics project analyzing customer shopping trends and behaviors using Python and SQL. This project explores purchasing patterns, customer segmentation, and key business insights from customer transaction data.

## üìã Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of 3,900+ customer shopping transactions to uncover valuable insights about customer behavior, purchase patterns, and revenue drivers. The analysis combines data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and SQL-based business intelligence queries to answer critical business questions.

## üîç Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python)

- **Data Loading**: Imported dataset using pandas
- **Missing Values**: Handled missing `Review Rating` values by filling with median rating per product category
- **Column Standardization**: 
  - Converted column names to lowercase
  - Replaced spaces with underscores
  - Renamed `Purchase Amount (USD)` to `purchase_amount`
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created `age_group` feature using quartile-based segmentation (Young Adult, Adult, Middle Aged, Senior)
  - Created `purchase_frequency_days` to convert frequency categories to numeric days
- **Data Quality**: 
  - Identified and removed duplicate column (`promo_code_used` identical to `discount_applied`)
- **Database Export**: Loaded cleaned data into MySQL database for SQL analysis

### 2. SQL Analysis & Business Intelligence

The SQL analysis explores 10 key business questions:

#### Revenue Analysis
1. **Gender-based Revenue**: Total revenue comparison between male and female customers
2. **Discount Impact**: Identified high-value customers who used discounts but still spent above average

#### Product Performance
3. **Top-Rated Products**: Top 5 products with highest average review ratings
4. **Discount Usage by Product**: Products with highest discount usage percentage

#### Shipping & Logistics
5. **Shipping Cost Analysis**: Average purchase amounts for Standard vs. Express shipping

#### Customer Behavior
6. **Subscription Impact**: Average spend and total revenue comparison between subscribers and non-subscribers
7. **Customer Segmentation**: Classified customers as New (1 purchase), Returning (2-10), or Loyal (>10 previous purchases)
8. **Repeat Buyer Subscription**: Correlation between repeat buyers and subscription status

#### Product Category Insights
9. **Top Products by Category**: Top 3 most purchased products within each category

#### Demographic Insights
10. **Age Group Revenue**: Revenue contribution analysis across different age groups

## ÔøΩ Interactive Dashboard

### Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard (`Customer_Behavior_Dashboard.pbix`) visualizes key metrics and insights:

![Customer Behavior Dashboard](./dashboard.png)

**Dashboard Features:**
- **Key Metrics Cards**: 
  - Total Customers: 3.9K
  - Average Purchase Amount: $59.76
  - Average Review Rating: 3.75
  
- **Subscription Analysis**: Pie chart showing 27% subscribers vs 73% non-subscribers

- **Revenue Insights**:
  - Revenue by Category (bar chart)
  - Revenue by Age Group (horizontal bar chart)
  
- **Sales Performance**:
  - Sales by Category breakdown
